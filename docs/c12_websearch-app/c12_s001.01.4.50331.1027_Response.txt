  Lexington is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 7,320.[4] It is the county
    seat of Rockbridge County, although the two are separate jurisdictions, and is combined with it for statistical purposes by the Bureau of Economic
    Analysis.[5] Lexington is within the Shenandoah Valley about 57 miles (92 km) east of the West Virginia border and is about 50 miles (80 km) north
    of Roanoke, Virginia. First settled in 1778, Lexington is best known as the home of the Virginia Military Institute and Washington and Lee
    University.
  Lexington was named in 1778. It was the first of what would be many American places named after Lexington, Massachusetts, known for being the
    place at which the first shot was fired in the American Revolution.[6]
  The Union General David Hunter led a raid on Virginia Military Institute during the American Civil War. Robert E. Lee and Thomas "Stonewall"
    Jackson are buried in the city. It is the site of the only house Jackson ever owned, now open to the public as a museum.[7] Cyrus McCormick
    invented the horse-drawn mechanical reaper at his family's farm in Rockbridge County,[8] and a statue of McCormick is located on the Washington
    and Lee University campus.[9] McCormick Farm is now owned by Virginia Tech and is a satellite agricultural research center.[10]
  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), virtually all of which is land.[11] The Maury River,
    a tributary of the James River, forms the city's northeastern boundary.
  The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.  According to the Köppen climate
    classification system, Lexington has a humid subtropical climate, similar to Northern Italy, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[12] Average
    monthly temperatures range from 34.9 °F in January to 75.2 °F in July.[13] The hardiness zone is 7a.[14]

  Lexington's primary economic activities stem from higher education and tourism. With its various connections to the Civil War, Lexington attracts
    visitors from around the country. Places of interest in Lexington include the Stonewall Jackson House, University Chapel, the George C. Marshall
    Library, Virginia Military Institute Museum, Museum of Military Memorabilia, and the downtown historic district. Hull's Drive In theater attracts
    visitors to the area and was the first community-owned, non-profit drive-in in the U.S. The non-profit Virginia Horse Center is a significant
    regional equestrian event facility.
  Lexington also contains a host of small retail businesses, bed and breakfast inns, and restaurants catering to a unique mixture of local, tourist,
    and collegiate clientele. The historic R. E. Lee Hotel, built in the 1920s, underwent extensive renovation and re-opened its doors late 2014.
  Lexington High School, designed by architect Charles M. Robinson and constructed in 1908, was typical of the modern public schools that cities
    built during the Progressive Era.

  The News-Gazette is the weekly community paper; it also produces a free shopper known as The Weekender. The now-defunct The Rockbridge Weekly,
    noted for printing police and other local crime reports, was bought by The News-Gazette in June 2012. The Rockbridge Advocate is a monthly news
    magazine with the motto "Independent as a hog on ice". The Ring-tum Phi, student newspaper of W&L, has been published since 1897 (with a
    suspension for World War II).[28]
  Lexington is the city of license for radio stations WIQR (88.7 FM), WMRL (89.9 FM), and WLUR (91.5 FM)[29] on W&L campus.
  Lexington is located at the intersection of historic U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 60 and more modern highways, Interstate 64 and Interstate 81.
    RADAR Transit operates the Maury Express, which provides local bus service to Lexington and Buena Vista.[30] The Virginia Breeze provides
    intercity bus service between Blacksburg and Washington, D.C., with a stop in Lexington.[31]
  The 1938 movie, Brother Rat, which starred Ronald Reagan, was shot in Lexington. After the release, Reagan was made an honorary VMI cadet. The
    1958 Mardi Gras starred Pat Boone as a VMI cadet appearing with actress Christine Carère. Sommersby from 1993 starred Richard Gere, Bill Pullman,
    James Earl Jones, and Jodie Foster. Foreign Student, released in 1994, was based on a novel of college life by former W&L student Phillipe Labro
    with related scenes made in town.[32] In Fall 2004, the director Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise filmed scenes for War of the Worlds here, with
    Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins. In June 2013, filming took place for a movie titled Field of Lost Shoes about the Battle of New Market starring
    Luke Benward and Lauren Holly.
  Filming for parts of several Civil War films also took place in Lexington, including the documentary Lee Beyond the Battles and Gods and Generals.
  In 2011, the city erupted in controversy after the City Council passed an ordinance to ban the flying of flags other than the United States flag,
    the Virginia Flag, and an as-yet-undesigned city flag on city light poles. Various flags of the Confederacy had previously been flown on city
    light poles to commemorate the Virginia holiday, Lee–Jackson Day, which is observed on the Friday before Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.[33] About
    300 Confederate flag supporters, including members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, rallied before the City Council meeting,[34] and after the
    vote the Sons of Confederate Veterans vowed to challenge the new local ordinance in court.[33] Previously, flags such as the Washington and Lee
    University and Virginia Military Institute flags had also been flown on city light poles, but the practice is now discontinued due to the city's
    ordinance.[citation needed]
  In 2014, a large Confederate battle flag and a number of related state flags were removed from Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University. The
    flags were moved to a rotating display at the Lee Chapel Museum.[35][36]
  Red Hen restaurant controversy[edit]
  The Red Hen restaurant was the site of the June 22, 2018, precipitating event for the Red Hen restaurant controversy in which a restaurant
    co-owner asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave the restaurant by citing Huckabee Sanders' role in the Trump
    administration.[37] The incident sparked national controversy.[37]

place at which the first shot was fired in the American Revolution.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.5 square miles (6.5 km²), virtually all of which is land. The Maury River, a
