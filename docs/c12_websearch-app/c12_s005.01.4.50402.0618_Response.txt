Based on the provided articles, here is a summary of the city's restaurants:

Lexington has a variety of small retail businesses, bed and breakfast inns, and restaurants that cater to local, tourist, and collegiate
    clientele. Some specific mentions include:

* Hull's Drive In theater, which attracts visitors to the area
* The Red Hen restaurant, which was at the center of a controversy in 2018 when its co-owner asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee
    Sanders to leave due to her role in the Trump administration.
* Other restaurants are mentioned as part of the city's downtown historic district and attractions, but specific names are not provided.

It appears that there is no comprehensive list of restaurants in Lexington available through these sources. However, visitors can expect to find a
    variety of small, local eateries and establishments catering to different tastes and preferences.
